A billing statement is a monthly report that credit card
companies issue to credit card customers showing their recent transactions,
minimum payment due, and other relevant information.
Billing statements are typically issued 
at the end of each monthly billing cycle and cardholders can receive them by mail or online.

there are four types of bills:
Ordinary Bills,
Money Bills, 
The Finance Bill, 
and Constitutional Amendment Bills,
and we even understood how the bills are passed and all about that.
